# ExampleUnitTestsWithMocks

This is the source code for the tutorial about writing unit-tests using mocks.

Part 1 of the unit-testing tutorial is [here](https://github.com/ice-lenor/ExampleUnitTests).

# Tutorial

The tutorial is not ready yet; but you can read some articles about unit-testing here:

## What to do with this
1. Open the tutorial.
1. Open `UserAgeCalculator.java`. Review the code.
1. Open `UserAgeCalculatorTest1.java`. What problems do you see with this test?
1. Open `UserAgeCalculatorTest2.java` and see how we solved one of the problems.
1. Open `UserAgeCalculatorTest3.java` and see how we got rid of some copy-paste that we introduced in `UserAgeCalculatorTest2.java`.
1. Tests in `UserAgeCalculatorTest3.java` are still failing. Why? Can you think of a way to fix them?

## How to run tests
I run this with Intellij IDEA and Java 1.8+.
1. Download the source code.
2. Open the folder with the code in Intellij IDEA.
3. Open the file `UserAgeCalculatorTest1.java`. You'll see green "Run test" buttons next to line numbers. Press the one next to `class UserAgeCalculatorTest1` and watch the test suite execute.
